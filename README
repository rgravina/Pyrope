* Introduction *

Pyrope is a remote GUI framework, built using wxPython and Twisted. Programmers 
can use the framework to program their client/server GUI-based applications in 
much the same way as they would a standalone GUI application. 

For the programmer: it saves them the hassle of writing clients and servers. 
Concentrate on the application you are trying to build, and let Pyrope remote 
the UI for you!

For ther user: You can access your applications from any computer that has the 
Pyrope client installed - all the benifits of web-based applications, without 
a user interface that sucks! 

* About the name *

Many programming tools are named after precious stones or minerals - the Ruby 
programming language, Quartz in Mac OSX etc.

This project was inspired (in part) by the ease of application development in 
the Jade programming lanaguage (yes, another stone)...

So why Pyrope? Many Python projects begin with "Py", and Pyrope is a mineral.
You could go one further and say that Pyrope extends your GUI out to remote 
computers but allows your easy access to it, as it if was connected by a 
"rope"... but that might be stretching things a little.

* About the authour *

My name is Robert Gravina. I was looking for a way to simplfiy the way 
applications are built and deployed over networks. Why are web applications 
so popular despite the UI straightjacket they present users, designers and 
developers? I think the answer is simple - users like the fact that can access
their applications from their web browser and developers like the fact that 
they don't have to develop the client software. Pyrope is an attempt to 
bring this to the world of desktop applications.

* Acknowlegements *
Pyrope would not have been possible wihout wxWidgets and wxPython, Twisted 
Python, the Python langague itself.
