* Introduction *

Pyrope is a remote GUI framework, built using wxPython and Twisted. Programmers 
can use the framework to program their client/server GUI-based applications in 
much the same way as they would a standalone GUI application. 

For the programmer: it saves you the hassle of writing clients and servers. 
Concentrate on the application you are trying to build, and let Pyrope remote 
the UI for you!

For ther user: You can access your applications from any computer that has the 
Pyrope client installed - all the benifits of web-based applications, without 
a user interface that sucks! 

* About the name *

Many programming tools are named after precious stones or minerals - the Ruby 
programming language, Quartz in Mac OSX etc.

So why Pyrope? Many Python projects begin with "Py", and Pyrope is a mineral.
You could go one further and say that Pyrope extends your GUI out to remote 
computers but allows your easy access to it, as it if was connected by a 
"rope"... but that might be stretching things a little.

* Why did you create Pyrope? *

I was looking for a way to simplfiy the way applications are built and 
deployed over networks. Why are web applications so popular despite the UI 
straightjacket they present users, designers and developers? I think the answer
is simple - users like the fact that can access their applications from a  
web browser and developers like the fact that they don't have to develop the 
client software. Pyrope is an attempt to bring this to the world of desktop 
applications.

* Acknowlegements *
Pyrope would not have been possible wihout wxWidgets and wxPython, Twisted 
Python, the Python langague itself.
